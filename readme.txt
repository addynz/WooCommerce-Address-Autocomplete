Addy's address autocomplete uses the latest address data from official sources with advanced search methods to improve the speed, accuracy and customer experience of your WooCommerce checkout page.

== Description ==

With Addy, you can validate and get the right address data at the point of capture, reducing the need to clean it once it's in your database.  Reduce cost by delivering first time, every time.

Completing billing and shipping address details is often seen as a friction point in online shopping. 
It takes up time and is even worse when completing an order from a small smartphone. 
Hence the reason for cart abandonment.

WooCommerce retailers have the opportunity to turn a pain point into a selling point.  
Usability research shows that address autocomplete with type-ahead verification, improves speed 
and accuracy that will leave shoppers feeling positive about their checkout experience.

= Validate addresses with accuracy as you type =
Customers can complete orders faster and addresses are validated in real-time against official NZ Post and LINZ databases.  
This will allow you to increase your online sales and reduce orders containing incomplete or undeliverable shipping details.
 
= Solve shipping issues = 
Addy uses advanced fuzzy error correction to ensure that addresses can be found and populated quickly and accurately. 
This means that if a typo, invalid suburb or partially correct address is entered, your customers can still find the right 
delivery or billing address because the addresses are validated against actual delivery point data from official 
address sources, including the New Zealand Postal Address File (PAF).
